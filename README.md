## Problem and Solution
Nowadays people have an account in almost all social medias, In networking with other people sending links separatly and paragraphs that contian all the social medias can be anoyning, un-proffesional and in-efficiant.
We provide a sloution for that where users can gather all there social contacts into a single web page were it is accessable every where and easliy managable through dashboard.
Sending a single link or qr code that contains all desired social medias is all you need.   

## Project scope

## Success Criteria
To determine the success of the Social Links Page project, the following measurable criteria have been established:

1. **Complete User Authentication System**
   A fully functional login and signup mechanism that securely manages user registration, authentication, and access control.
2. **Interactive Dashboard with Full CRUD Functionality**
   A responsive and intuitive dashboard that enables users to create, read, update, and delete their social media links efficiently.
3. **Publicly Accessible User Pages**
   Each user’s customized social links page must be successfully deployed and accessible through a public URL.
4. **Structured and Well-Designed Database Schema**
   A properly designed and normalized database diagram ensuring data integrity, scalability, and maintainability.
5. **Robust and Well-Documented APIs**

## Workflow Diagrams

### Creating a Social Button

```
User Clicks Add Button → Server Receives Request → Validate Domain → Insert into buttonLinks → Insert into userButtonMapping (order)
```

### Searching Users by Interest

```
Search Input → Find Interest ID → Get Users with that Interest → Return user cards with profile info
```

### Reporting a User

```
User Submits a Report → Save into Reports Table → Admin Review → Update Status (RESOLVED / REJECTED) + ReasonOfAction
```

## Database overview
Here is a qucik discription of the database

### `users`

This is the **central table** — everything else connects to users.

**Fields summary:**

* `id`: Primary key
* `username`, `email`, `name`, `phoneNo`: Basic user info
* `profileImage`: Blob for the user’s avatar
* `passwordHashed`: Hashed password (good security practice)
* `role`: Enum for roles (e.g., admin, user, moderator)
* `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps for account tracking
* `isDeleted`, `isPremium`: Status flags
* `failedLoginAttempts`: For login security

**Purpose:** Stores all registered users and their profile data.



### `themePresets` + `userPage`

* `themePresets` defines the **available design themes** (e.g., “dark mode,” “minimalist”).
* `userPage` links each user to a chosen theme:

  * `userId` → references `users.id`
  * `themeId` → references `themePresets.id`

**Purpose:** Every user can have their own page with a selected theme.



### `buttonLinks` + `userButtonMapping`

* `buttonLinks` contains information about **link buttons** (e.g., “GitHub,” “Instagram,” “Portfolio”):

  * Fields like `title`, `description`, `icon`, `link`, `timestampOfCreation`, etc.
  * `isActive` and `isVisible` indicate the button’s state.
  * `noClicks` can track analytics.

* `userButtonMapping` connects users to their buttons:

  * `userId` → references `users.id`
  * `buttonId` → references `buttonLinks.id`
  * `order` defines the button’s display sequence.

**Purpose:** Users can add, reorder, and manage multiple social buttons on their page.



### `reports`

Handles **user reporting system**, allowing reports on inappropriate users or content.

**Fields summary:**

* `emailOfReporter`: who submitted the report
* `reportedOnUser`: which user is being reported (linked to `users.id`)
* `title`, `description`: details about the issue
* `reportTypeId`: type/category of report
* `reportStatus`, `handledBy`, `reasonOfAction`: for admin moderation

**Purpose:** Supports community moderation and admin action tracking.



### `domainBlockList`

Contains **blocked domains**, likely to prevent users from linking to harmful or blacklisted websites.

**Purpose:** Used for link safety checks before allowing users to add a button link.



### `interests` + `userInterestMapping`

* `interests` lists all possible interest categories (e.g., “Technology,” “Design,” “Travel”).
* `userInterestMapping` connects users with their interests:

  * `userId` → references `users.id`
  * `interestId` → references `interests.id`

**Purpose:** Lets users define their personal interests, possibly for recommendation or filtering.



### Summary of Relationships

| Relationship                            | Type        | Description                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| users ↔ userPage                        | 1–1         | Each user has one page and one theme |
| users ↔ userButtonMapping ↔ buttonLinks | 1–M         | Users can have multiple links        |
| users ↔ reports                         | 1–M         | Users can be reported multiple times |
| users ↔ userInterestMapping ↔ interests | M–M         | Users can have multiple interests    |
| buttonLinks ↔ domainBlockList           | –           | Used indirectly for validation       |
| themePresets                            | independent | Defines reusable themes              |


### Overall
database is **clean, modular, and scalable** — it supports:

* User profiles with theming and customization
* Personal and social link management
* Interest-based personalization
* Security via blocked domains and report handling
* Analytics (click tracking)

**In short:**
This database powers a **customizable social link page platform** where users create personal pages with buttons (links) to their social media or content, choose themes, declare interests, and where admins can handle reports and restrict unsafe domains.
